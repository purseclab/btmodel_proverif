# Strong secrecy violation of the keys (no OOB public key exchange and output OOB authentication)

This attack trace is similar to `tableIII_row5_columnC1_attack-provision-5--NoOOBpkOutputOOBAuth--C1`.

The attacker can use the same procedure to obtains `keys`.
Of course, the attacker can tell whether `keys` is changed or not.
