# Strong secrecy violation of the keys (no OOB public key exchange and static OOB authentication)

This attack trace is similar to `tableIII_row8_columnC1_attack-provision-8--NoOOBpkNoOOBAuth--C1`.

The attacker can use the same procedure to obtains `keys`.
Of course, the attacker can tell whether `keys` changes or not.
